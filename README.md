This project includes html, css and php files necessary fot a website used to operate with a connected smart thermostat designed by a team of year 2 undergraduate students in IC London. A bootstrap base was used for the js aspects of the website.
The website is also used to explain the project as a whole. Databases were hosted by the university's servers and are not available anymore, explaining impossible access to the member's area.
The website is not suitable for mobile usage.
